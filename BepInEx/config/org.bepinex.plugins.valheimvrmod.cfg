## The VR mirror mode.Legal values: OpenVR, Right, Left, None. Note: OpenVR is required if you want to see the Overlay-type GUI in the mirror image. However, I've found that OpenVR mirror mode causes some issue that requires SteamVR to be restarted after closing the game, so unless you need it for some specific reason, I recommend using another mirror mode or None.

[Graphics]

## RECOMMENDED - Determines whether or not to use the Amplify Occlusion post processing effect. This implements an effect similar to SSAO but with much less performance cost. While you can enable SSAO and UseAmplifyOcclusion simultaneously, it is not recommended. SSAO impacts performance significantly, which is bad for VR especially. Therefore you should disable SSAO in the graphics settings of the game when using this.
